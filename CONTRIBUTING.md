## Labels naming convention

In order to improve issues management and to make information clearer and easily identifiable, a set of pre-defined labels has been created. Those labels are strictly structured in three main groups, each group giving a particular useful information about the issue. This means that for each issue you open, you must assign it exactly one label of each group, and update them all along the issue's lifecycle as it evolves.
